## DEPENDENCY SECURITY AUDIT

**Date:** June 13, 2025

---

### 1. Purpose  
Audit front‑end dependencies used in `Musicvvv`, focusing on identifying packages with active vulnerabilities and recommending a secure replacement where needed.

---

### 2. Scope & Affected Packages  
Among the dependencies audited, only **`axios`** has a known critical vulnerability:

| Package | Version | CVE | Severity | Description | Fixed In |
|--------|---------|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| axios | ^1.8.4 | CVE‑2025‑27152 | High (7.5) | SSRF & credential leakage when absolute URLs passed—even when `baseURL` is set. | 1.8.2+ |

*No other dependencies, including `@radix‑ui`, showed known vulnerabilities in Snyk or GitHub advisories.

---

### 3. Zero‑Day Vulnerability Policy  
- Monitoring: Dependabot, Snyk, security mailing lists  
- Review: Within 24 hours of alert  
- For high/critical issues: block builds and apply patch or replacement immediately

---

### 4. Recommendation: Replace `axios` with `ky`

#### 4.1 Why `ky`?  
- Built atop the native Fetch API (no bundled dependencies → smaller attack surface)  
- Actively maintained and lightweight  
- Automatically inherits browser’s security posture

#### 4.2 Security Evaluation Steps  
1. **Dependency health**: checked `ky`’s GitHub activity and latest releases ► active maintenance  
2. **Vulnerability scan**: Snyk and npm audit show no known issues in latest `ky` versions  
3. **Code analysis**: examined source on GitHub – minimal surface area, no internal parsing or URL normalization flaws  
4. **License check**: MIT licensed  
5. **Surface analysis**: no transitive dependencies that introduce risk

### 5. Audit Summary Table  

| Package | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| axios | High-severity SSRF (CVE‑2025‑27152) | Replacing with `ky` |
| All others | No known issues | Continued monitoring via CI tools |
