### 3. Methodology
1. **Automated scan**: ran `npm audit --omit=dev` to detect known vulnerabilities in `dependencies`.  
2. **Secondary scan**: used Snyk CLI to cross-verify findings and detect issues not yet present in npm advisories.  
3. **OWASP dependency-check**: ensured coverage of CVEs in our supply chain.  
4. **Manual review**: for high-value packages (UI frameworks, HTTP clients), inspected GitHub security advisories and release notes.  
5. **Zero-day policy**: maintain subscriptions to Dependabot, Snyk alerts, and security mailing lists. All new reports trigger a triage within 24 hours.

### 4. Findings
All packages have been verified against public vulnerability databases as of June 12, 2025:

| Package               | Severity of Findings | Action Taken               |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Dependencies**      |                      |                            |
| *All listed above*    | No critical/zero-day | No action required         |
| **Dev Dependencies**  |                      |                            |
| *All listed above*    | No critical          | No action required         |


### 5. Zero-Day Vulnerability Policy
- **Monitoring:** GitHub Dependabot, Snyk alerts, vendor mailing lists.  
- **Triage:** Security team reviews notifications within 24 hours, assigns severity based on impact.  
- **Response:** For high/critical issues, block new builds, create PRs for immediate patch or replacement.

### 6. Remediation & Ongoing Measures
- **CI Integration:** `npm audit` gating on high/critical; Snyk CLI in nightly jobs.  
- **Scheduled Reviews:** Quarterly dependency re-audit and version bump.  
- **Documentation Updates:** This file lives in `docs/` and is updated on each audit cycle.
